## Outstanding Issues

This assignment proved more difficult for me to fully execute specifically around advancing the questions and respective answer choices within each, as well as getting the quiz to stop and forward to the record scores page.

Another issue I was having was in trying to record when a user clicked on the correct answer and to add points for that user to the score counter.

At this point I was not able to finish the exercise wher I set the initials of the user into localStorage and called it back in the Highscores page.

## Contributions / Credits

On September 9th, 2020, TA - Stanley Lewis helped me understand how to hard code the logic for onclick event of my button options and advancing my questions.

Sami Sully helped me with formatting...
